### About me
Hi, my name is Queen. 

In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses and self-study. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also recently started learning test automation in Python, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.
